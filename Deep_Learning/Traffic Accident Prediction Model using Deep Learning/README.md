# 🚦 Traffic Accident Prediction Model using Deep Learning 

Welcome to the **Traffic Accident Prediction** project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques and historical data (e.g., accident records, weather conditions, traffic volume, road characteristics) to predict the likelihood of traffic accidents. Our aim is to provide insights into high-risk areas and conditions, enabling local authorities to implement targeted safety measures and improve traffic management strategies.

## 🌟 Overview
Traffic accidents can have severe consequences, both human and economic. This project aims to leverage deep learning to predict accident risks based on various features:
- 📅 **Date & Time**
- 🌦️ **Weather Conditions**
- 🚗 **Traffic Volume**
- 🛣️ **Road Characteristics**

By identifying high-risk situations, the model helps authorities and traffic planners reduce accident occurrences and improve public safety.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Accurate Predictions**: Provides reliable accident risk assessments based on multiple inputs.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Visualizes accident patterns with charts and graphs for better insights.
- 🚧 **Model Evaluation**: Uses evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- 🌐 **Scalable**: Easily extendable to include more features like traffic camera data.

## 🗃️ Dataset

| Feature           | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `date_time`       | Date and time of the incident       |
| `weather`         | Weather conditions at the time       |
| `traffic_volume`  | Number of vehicles passing per hour  |
| `road_type`       | Type of road (highway, city road)    |

The dataset is stored as a CSV file in the `data/` folder. If you have new data, update the file accordingly.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The model consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for feature extraction and time-series analysis. The architecture includes:

- **Input Layer**: Processes the input features (e.g., weather, traffic volume).
- **CNN Layers**: Extracts spatial features.
- **LSTM Layers**: Captures temporal dependencies.
- **Dense Layers**: Combines extracted features and outputs the prediction.

## 📈 Evaluation

The model’s performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

| Metric      | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**| The overall correctness of the model             |
| **Precision**| Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations |
| **Recall**  | Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the actual positives |
| **F1-Score**| Harmonic mean of precision and recall            |

---

## 📊 Results

The model achieved the following performance on the test dataset:

| Metric   | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Accuracy | 92%   |
| Precision| 89%   |
| Recall   | 90%   |
| F1-Score | 89.5% |
