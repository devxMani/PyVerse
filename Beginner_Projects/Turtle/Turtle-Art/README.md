# **PYTHON TURTLE ART GENERATOR**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**
The goal of this project is to create a dynamic, interactive program that draws random patterns using geometric shapes like squares, circles, triangles, and stars. Users can customize the background color, turtle speed, and the number of shapes drawn.

## ðŸ§¾ **Description**
This project leverages the turtle module to draw random shapes at random locations on the screen. Users can choose background colors, control the drawing speed, and specify the number of shapes to be generated. The program creates a visually appealing display of geometric patterns using random colors, all within an interactive Python environment.

## ðŸ§® **What I had done!**
Created functions to draw squares, circles, triangles, and stars.
Implemented random color generation to enhance the visual experience.
Added user customization features for background color, turtle speed, and the number of shapes.
Developed a function to randomly place and draw these shapes on the screen with varying sizes.
Included input validation to ensure smooth user interaction.

## ðŸ“š **Libraries Needed**
turtle: A Python standard library used to create graphics and shapes.
random: Used for generating random colors, positions, and selecting random shapes.
Both libraries are part of Python's standard library, so no external installation is needed.

## ðŸ“¢ **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how Python's turtle graphics can be used to create customizable visual displays with random patterns. It highlights user interaction, simple input validation, and the use of basic shapes to generate interesting graphics. Future improvements could include more shape options, enhanced user controls, and improved input handling.
